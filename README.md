Automation Testing with Docker and CI/CD

Project Overview
This project demonstrates automation testing using Docker and CI/CD principles, aimed at making software testing efficient, scalable, and repeatable. It was developed as part of my learning experience in the “Proficient Automation Tester by Leveraging Docker with CI/CD” course on Udemy.

Key Concepts Covered:
Docker: Containerized test environments for easy setup and consistency across different environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Integration of automated testing into Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines for faster feedback and better software quality.
Automation Testing: Streamlining testing processes to ensure faster and more reliable test execution.

Features

Cross-platform execution: Run tests on local Selenium Grid or cloud platforms like LambdaTest.

Parallel execution: Configure parallel test execution via TestNG.

Logging and reporting: Uses Log4j2 for logging and Extent Reports for detailed reporting.

Docker support: Execute tests using Docker containers for isolated environments.

Config-driven execution: Modify config.properties to change test parameters dynamically.

GitHub Actions Integration: Leverage an integrated GitHub Actions workflow to automate testing, streamline CI/CD pipelines, and provide continuous feedback on code changes.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java
Testing Framework: TestNG
Build Tool: Maven
WebDriver Management: Selenium 4
Version Control: GitHub (for code hosting and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation)
CI/CD Tool: Jenkins (for managing continuous integration and delivery pipelines)
Containerization: Docker (for running tests in isolated, consistent environments)
